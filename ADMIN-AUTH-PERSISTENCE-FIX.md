# Admin Portal Authentication Persistence Fix

## Problem
After logging into the admin portal with a verified wallet and completing Asgardeo authentication, refreshing the page would redirect back to the admin welcome screen instead of staying on the admin dashboard.

## Root Cause
The authentication state in `AuthContext.tsx` was not being persisted across page refreshes. When the page reloaded:
1. The `AuthContext` would reset all authentication state to initial values
2. `isFullyAuthenticated` would be `false` during the loading period
3. The admin page's `useEffect` would immediately redirect to `/adminLogin`
4. Even after authentication was revalidated, the redirect had already occurred

## Solution
Modified the authentication system to persist the authentication state in localStorage:

### 1. Enhanced AuthContext (`src/context/AuthContext.tsx`)
- **State Persistence**: Save fully authenticated state to localStorage with timestamp
- **State Restoration**: Restore saved state on page load if not expired (24-hour expiration)
- **Graceful Loading**: Show loading state while revalidating authentication
- **Auto Cleanup**: Clear saved state when not fully authenticated or on errors

### 2. Updated Admin Page (`src/app/admin/page.tsx`)
- **Loading-Aware Redirect**: Only redirect after loading is complete and authentication is confirmed invalid
- **Enhanced Loading States**: Show appropriate loading messages during authentication check
- **State Cleanup**: Clear saved state when explicitly disconnecting wallet

### 3. Updated Admin Welcome (`src/components/admin/admin-welcome.tsx`)
- **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Clear saved authentication state when disconnecting wallet
- **Error Handling**: Ensure state is cleared even if disconnection fails

## Key Features

### Persistence Logic
```typescript
// Save state only when fully authenticated
if (authState.isFullyAuthenticated) {
  localStorage.setItem('adminAuthState', JSON.stringify(authState));
  localStorage.setItem('adminAuthStateTime', Date.now().toString());
}

// Restore state on load (with 24-hour expiration)
const savedAuth = localStorage.getItem('adminAuthState');
const saveTime = localStorage.getItem('adminAuthStateTime');
if (savedAuth && saveTime && Date.now() - parseInt(saveTime) < 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) {
  return { ...parsedAuth, isLoading: true }; // Still revalidate
}
```

### Loading State Management
```typescript
// Only redirect after loading is complete
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isLoading && !isFullyAuthenticated) {
    router.push('/adminLogin')
  }
}, [isFullyAuthenticated, isLoading, router])
```

### Cleanup on Disconnect
```typescript
const handleWalletDisconnect = async () => {
  // Clear saved state immediately
  localStorage.removeItem('adminAuthState')
  localStorage.removeItem('adminAuthStateTime')
  
  // Then proceed with disconnect
  await disconnect()
  // ... rest of cleanup
}
```

## Benefits
1. **No More Unwanted Redirects**: Users stay on admin dashboard after page refresh
2. **Security Maintained**: Authentication is still revalidated on each page load
3. **Automatic Expiration**: Saved state expires after 24 hours for security
4. **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to normal authentication flow if restoration fails
5. **Clean Disconnect**: Properly clears all state when user explicitly disconnects

## Testing Instructions
1. Connect wallet and complete Asgardeo login to access admin dashboard
2. Verify you see the admin dashboard (not the welcome screen)
3. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. ✅ You should stay on the admin dashboard (not redirect to welcome)
5. Click "Disconnect Wallet" button
6. ✅ You should be redirected to adminLogin/welcome screen
7. Refresh again
8. ✅ You should stay on the welcome screen (not auto-login)

## Debug Commands
The AuthContext now provides a debug function accessible via:
```javascript
// In browser console:
window.authDebug() // If exposed globally, or access via React dev tools
```

## Files Modified
- `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` - Enhanced with persistence logic
- `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Updated redirect logic and cleanup
- `src/components/admin/admin-welcome.tsx` - Enhanced cleanup on disconnect

## Security Considerations
- Saved state expires after 24 hours
- Authentication is still revalidated on every page load
- Sensitive tokens are not persisted indefinitely
- State is cleared immediately on explicit disconnect
- Graceful fallback if localStorage is not available
